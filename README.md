# Easycall-PHP-cURL-Utilities
This file contains the three basic functions  needed from PHP to interact with Easycall API:  cURL GET, POST,  and DELETE methods. Each function sets the cURL options expected by the API endpoint, adds the authentication header, builds the parameter list, and makes the API call.

To install, simply place this file in your project directory and include it in your PHP script.
